# freelapse

Freelapse is a free time tracking tool intended for independent contractors. One thing that really frustrates me about
other "free" platforms is there's usually a buy-in process to get invoices, and most of the time they can't even be
customized. One thing I hope to accomplish with this truly free software is to give users the ability to customize their
invoices with HTML and CSS and share those to other people in the community.

This is very much still a work in progress, and I will continue to update this README as more features are defined.
